## Application Overview
- **Domain**: [e.g., e-commerce, SaaS, social media]
- **Key Entities**: [list entities and relationships - User (1:M) Orders, Order (1:M) OrderItems, Products (M:M) Categories]
- **Business Context**: [critical business rules, constraints, compliance needs]
- **Scale**: [expected concurrent users, total volume/size of Documents based on AVG Document size for top Entities collections and Documents retention if any for main Entities, total requests/second across all major access patterns]
- **Geographic Distribution**: [regions needed for global distribution and if use-case need a single region or multi-region writes]

## Access Patterns Analysis
| Pattern # | Description | RPS (Peak and Average) | Type | Attributes Needed | Key Requirements | Design Considerations | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|--------|
| 1 | Get user profile by user ID when the user logs into the app | 500 RPS | Read | userId, name, email, createdAt | <50ms latency | Simple point read with id and partition key | |
| 2 | Create new user account when the user is on the sign up page| 50 RPS | Write | userId, name, email, hashedPassword | Strong consistency | Consider unique key constraints for email | |

CRITICAL: Every pattern MUST have RPS documented. If USER doesn't know, help estimate based on business context.

## Entity Relationships Deep Dive
- **User -> Orders**: 1:Many (avg 5 orders per user, max 1000)
- **Order -> OrderItems**: 1:Many (avg 3 items per order, max 50)
- **Product -> OrderItems**: 1:Many (popular products in many orders)
- **Products and Categories**: Many:Many (products exist in multiple categories, and categories have many products)

## Enhanced Aggregate Analysis
For each potential aggregate, analyze:

### [Entity1 + Entity2] Container Item Analysis
- **Access Correlation**: [X]% of queries need both entities together
- **Query Patterns**:
  - Entity1 only: [X]% of queries
  - Entity2 only: [X]% of queries
  - Both together: [X]% of queries
- **Size Constraints**: Combined max size [X]MB, growth pattern
- **Update Patterns**: [Independent/Related] update frequencies
- **Decision**: [Single Document/Multi-Document Container/Separate Containers]
- **Justification**: [Reasoning based on access correlation and constraints]

### Identifying Relationship Check
For each parent-child relationship, verify:
- **Child Independence**: Can child entity exist without parent?
- **Access Pattern**: Do you always have parent_id when querying children?
- **Current Design**: Are you planning cross-partition queries for parent->child queries?

If answers are No/Yes/Yes then use identifying relationship (partition key=parent_id) instead of separate container with cross-partition queries.

Example:
### User + Orders Container Item Analysis
- **Access Correlation**: 45% of queries need user profile with recent orders
- **Query Patterns**:
  - User profile only: 55% of queries
  - Orders only: 20% of queries
  - Both together: 45% of queries (AP31 pattern)
- **Size Constraints**: User 2KB + 5 recent orders 15KB = 17KB total, bounded growth
- **Update Patterns**: User updates monthly, orders created daily - acceptable coupling
- **Identifying Relationship**: Orders cannot exist without Users, always have user_id when querying orders
- **Decision**: Multi-Document Container (UserOrders container)
- **Justification**: 45% joint access + identifying relationship eliminates need for cross-partition queries

## Container Consolidation Analysis

After identifying aggregates, systematically review for consolidation opportunities:

### Consolidation Decision Framework
For each pair of related containers, ask:

1. **Natural Parent-Child**: Does one entity always belong to another? (Order belongs to User)
2. **Access Pattern Overlap**: Do they serve overlapping access patterns?
3. **Partition Key Alignment**: Could child use parent_id as partition key?
4. **Size Constraints**: Will consolidated size stay reasonable?

### Consolidation Candidates Review
| Parent | Child | Relationship | Access Overlap | Consolidation Decision | Justification |
|--------|-------|--------------|----------------|------------------------|---------------|
| [Parent] | [Child] | 1:Many | [Overlap] | Consolidate/Separate | [Why] |

### Consolidation Rules
- **Consolidate when**: >50% access overlap + natural parent-child + bounded size + identifying relationship
- **Keep separate when**: <30% access overlap OR unbounded growth OR independent operations
- **Consider carefully**: 30-50% overlap - analyze cost vs complexity trade-offs

## Design Considerations (Subject to Change)
- **Hot Partition Concerns**: [Analysis of high RPS patterns]
- **Large fan-out with Many Physical partitions based on total Datasize Concerns**: [Analysis of high number of physical partitions overhead for any cross-partition queries]
- **Cross-Partition Query Costs**: [Cost vs performance trade-offs]
- **Indexing Strategy**: [Composite indexes, included paths, excluded paths]
- **Multi-Document Opportunities**: [Entity pairs with 30-70% access correlation]
- **Multi-Entity Query Patterns**: [Patterns retrieving multiple related entities]
- **Denormalization Ideas**: [Attribute duplication opportunities]
- **Global Distribution**: [Multi-region write patterns and consistency levels]

## Multi-Document vs Separate Containers Decision Framework

When entities have 30-70% access correlation, choose between:

**Multi-Document Container (Same Container, Different Document Types):**
- Use when: Frequent joint queries, related entities, acceptable operational coupling
- Benefits: Single query retrieval, reduced latency, cost savings, transactional consistency
- Drawbacks: Shared throughput, operational coupling, complex indexing

**Separate Containers:**
- Use when: Independent scaling needs, different operational requirements
- Benefits: Clean separation, independent throughput, specialized optimization
- Drawbacks: Cross-partition queries, higher latency, increased cost

**Enhanced Decision Criteria:**
- **>70% correlation + bounded size + related operations** - Multi-Document Container
- **50-70% correlation** - Analyze operational coupling:
  - Same backup/restore needs? Multi-Document Container
  - Different scaling patterns? Separate Containers
  - Different consistency requirements? Separate Containers
- **<50% correlation** - Separate Containers
- **Identifying relationship present** - Strong Multi-Document Container candidate

CRITICAL: Stay in the requirements section until the user says to move on. Keep asking about other requirements. Capture all reads and writes. For example, ask: "Do you have any other access patterns to discuss? I see we have a user login access pattern but no pattern to create users. Should we add one?"
